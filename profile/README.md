## Computing Culture Undergraduate Journal

We are Northwestern University's premier undergraduate publication venue for critical essays at the intersection of technology, culture, and society. Broadly, we intend to foster free discourse regarding (1) the ever-shifting dynamics of how we live and work amidst technology and (2) the nature and implications of computer-scientific approaches to humanistic questions.
